Here are projects that I consider important to my learning:

- [Python and Selenium](https://github.com/Leftwardz/Selenium-Script)
- [What's App and Azure functions](https://github.com/Leftwardz/WhatsApp-API)
- [First Site Django](https://github.com/Leftwardz/Management-with-Django)
- [Front-End HTML CSS](https://github.com/Leftwardz/FrontEnd-Alura-Challenge)
- [Cloud Functions](https://github.com/Leftwardz/Serverless---Messages) Unfortunately, this server less message is not working anymore, but changing the keys to a working IBM account, it will work
